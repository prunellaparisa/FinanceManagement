2. Database: Managed with Entity Framework Core for data access.
3. Web Application: A Blazor application for the user interface, providing an interactive and dynamic web experience.
4. Mobile Application: Created using Xamarin/MAUI for cross-platform support, allowing users to access their financial data on the go.
5. Common Libraries: Shared libraries and components using OOP principles (like dependency injection) to ensure modularity and reusability.
